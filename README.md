ASP.NET CORE API with SQL SERVER for short URL creation 

You should see two endpoint "GET" and "POST"

   POST - lets you create a short url given the long url. Response will return response model with short url (called "link" in the return model.) Enter the link you got on browser and it should redirect you to the long url.

   GET - entr the code from return url in POST (called "code") and it should give you redirect, check the header for the location of the long url.

Two way to acess endpoints.

      1. IIS
        1. Add new site called "local.lit.ay"(host name), http type, port 80 and physical path to the url folder.
        2. Add "127.0.0.1 local.lit.ay" to host file on your machine (etc/host) 
        3. Give permission to IIS to access your folder 
            1. Right click and open properties of url folder select security tab and add two usernames/group.
                a. Users and IIS_IUSRS (Allow all permissions.)
        4. Update migration, if required (The app will automatically do it on app start).
        5. Open http://local.lit.ay/swagger/index.html in browser.
      
      2. Docker (Linux)
        1. Modify the host file with (127.0.0.1 lit.ay)
        2. Open the folder UrlCreation and search "cmd" on search of file explorer and hit enter.
        3. Once cmd opens run the command (docker-compose build). This will  build the images in the docker-compose.yml file.
        4. Once done run command (docker-compose up). THis will aggregate output of all the containers (urlcreation(api project) and urldatabase(sql server)).
        5. Open http:lit.ay:81/swagger/index.html in browser and you should see two endpoint Post and Get.
